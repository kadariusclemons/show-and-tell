    <h1>Monday Review - Show and Tell</h1>
    <p>
        Last week I learned about the importance of control flow. <br> <br> I also learned about if, else, and else if statements. <br> <br>
        I learned that control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a programming language. <br> <br>
        I also learned that if statements are used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. Else if statements are used to specify a new condition to test if the first condition is false, and Else statements are used to execute a block of code if all the previous conditions are false.
    </p>
